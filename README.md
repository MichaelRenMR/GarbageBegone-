# GarbageBegone-
An AI powered garbage sorter for differentiating cardboard, metal, and paper. For our purposes, we classified the trash in real time using the computer's webcam then sent the data over to an Arduino which controlled the mechanical filtering process. More information can be found in our [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/garbage-b-gone). 

## Dataset
The dataset was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification 

## Libraries 
The model was built using Tensorflow and Keras. For interfacing, we used [ecapture](https://pypi.org/project/ecapture/) to take pictures from the computer's webcam.
